method to convert array to List
#List<Integer>nums=Arrays.asList(2,4,4,5);#

- forEach method in Java
- What is a consumer interface?
- Lambda expression with consumer object
- How forEach method works?


#1
- forEach method got introduced in Java 1.8 version.
- The forEach() method of ArrayList is used to perform a certain operation for each element in ArrayList.
- forEach traverses each element of the Iterable until all the elements have been processed.
- Collection classes that extend the Iterable interface can use forEach loop to iterate elements.

#2
- forEach method takes an object of the consumer.
- Consumer is an interface that belongs to the java.util.function package.
- Consumer is a functional interface so lambda expression will also be applicable to it.
- Consumer has a method accept(), that takes a value of the same type of which object is created.

- forEach needs an object and we will pass an object of a consumer in it.
- forEach gives a value at a time and that value gets passed to the consumer object and taken by the accept method.
- We can do operations in this accept method.



List<Integer>nums=new ArrayList<>();
nums.forEach(n->System.out.println(n)); it return one element at each time

forEach method is part of "list interface"
forEach accepts Consumer object
which is an interface belongs to  java.util.function
it is a FUCNCTIONAL INTRFACE So Lambda expression can be implemented in it.
